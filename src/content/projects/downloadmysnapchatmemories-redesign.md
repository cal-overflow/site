title: Memory Download Redesign
tags:

---

Redesign the [Snapchat Memory Downloader](/portfolio/download-snapchat-memories) application to a cloud-based solution.

<!--more-->

Snapchat changed how they bundle your data for a download. Now, instead of a crappy JSON, they offer you the ability to download your memories directly. However, these downloaded memories do not have stickers/text/filters applied.

This redesign will allow users to upload their `zip` file of memories to a website that will automatically apply all filters/text/sticker with an updated `zip` file.

### Status
This re-work is partially completed, but has been put on pause because school / work / other projects taking higher priority.

**I may or may not return to this project.**
