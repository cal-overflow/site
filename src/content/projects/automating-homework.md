**YOUTUBE VIDEO** \
Create a video showcasing how I automated homework for a class.


<!--more-->

This is not a huge priority for me.


### Notes/Ideas

- Potential titles:
  - **How I created a robot to do my homework**
  - **Computer Science student creates robot to do homework**
  - **Software Engineer automates homework**
- Thumbnail ideas:
  - Me sitting in my chair eating popcorn kicked back with my legs sitting on my desk - possibly have screen show something like “A” or just a screenshot of the program in action
  - Alternatively have the terminal saying something like “Homework complete”
- This one would be a bit tricky. I will mostly be talking to the camera, potentially with the footage of the robot doing its thing in the background.
- **NOTE:** (pretty much all) footage of the homework doer would have to be blurred for obvious reasons
