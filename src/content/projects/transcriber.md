```markdown
**Person 1:** I'm saying something!

**Person 2:** Hey! I'm also saying something.

```


This may be a good time to leverage an AWS ML or AI service. I found [these docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/diarization.html) for Amazon Transcribe, which may be exactly what I'm looking for.
