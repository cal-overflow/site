This book was not at all what I expected. To be frank, I thought the cover looked dope and was interested that a book focused on thinking. However, soon after starting the book, *Thinking, Fast and Slow* became one of my favorite books.

<!--more-->

In essence, Daniel Kahneman dissects how Humans think. The term "think" is quite generic and encompasses various aspects of psychology like solving simple or complex problems, making decisions (big or small), and more. Additionally, Kahneman shines a unique light on current economics.

## Notes
### Two Systems
Kahneman defines two "systems" when it comes to thinking. Note that there are not actually two different thinking systems, but it is easy to discuss thinking in this manner.

#### System 1
Think of *System 1* as the source of fast thinking. When you intuitively know the answer to a question (such as `2 + 2 = ?`) your *System 1* is at play.
As Kahneman states, *System 1* is "the origin of much that we do wrong." Keep in mind, however, *System 1* is the source of much that we do.

#### System 2
*System 2* performs the analytical, methodical thinking. When we solve a complex math problem like `12 * 34 = ?`, *System 2* kicks in. This is the thinking that we cannot perform "on the fly." \
*System 2* can be described as **Lazy, but good**. We aren't good at solving complex problems 24/7. Thus *System 2* performs a much smaller portion of our thinking.

| Speed | Fast | Slow |
| Thinking | Automatic | Effortful |

### Two Species
Kahneman describes two different types of beings: Econs and Humans. Econs are completely rational and logically coherent. Humans are sometimes rational, but are not consistent in their thinking.

#### Econs
Econs will always result in the same answer when presented a question in different formats. The framing of a question does not impact the logical assessment that takes place in calculating an answer.

##### Econs are:
- Rational
- Logically coherent
- Consistent

#### Humans
Humans are not Econs. This is not to say that Humans are irrational. Rather, "Humans are not well described by the rational agent model". \
When proposed the same question, just framed differently, Humans often contradict their own answers.


### Two selves
The latter chapters of the book concern the two selves of a being.

#### Remembering Self
The remembering self, as its name implies, is the self comprised of memories. \
This is best explained by considering a movie that is thoroughly enjoyed until the ending has a dark twist. Although 99% of the movie was highly enjoyable, the memory of the movie is tainted by the final 1%.

#### Experiencing Self
The experiencing self is the present self. The experiencing self has far less influence on our future decisions. Instead, our experiencing self is temporary, and can be considered separate from how we will remember events. \
Consider a vacation that is only somewhat enjoyable. Photos taken on the vacation may be later viewed with feelings of great joy even though the level of joy was less for the experienced self.

### Miscellaneous
#### Question Substitution
When we are faced with a difficult question, we often substitute the question with an easier question. This often happens subconsciously.

For example,
> How much would you contribute to save an endangered species?

May subconsciously be substituted for:
> How much emotion do I feel when I think about dying dolphins?

#### Jumping to conclusions & Seeking causality
At this point it's practically common knowledge that humans love seeking causality. \
All sorts of people, including professional researches, will often jump to assume that a correlation is causality.

#### What You See Is All There Is (WYSIATI)
People naturally act on the little information readily available. \
**There is far more to a situation or problem than all that you know/see in the present.**

#### We're bad at probability
Humans are terrible at probability. \
This is mostly because we are lazy and rely on *System 1* instead of *System 2* (critical thinking).

#### Biases
- Hindsight bias
  - Everything makes sense in hindsight
- Outcome bias

#### Intuition vs Formulas (algorithms)
"Expert" intuition is really not that great. Often an "expert" is no better (worse) than an algorithm (assuming one exists).

## Quotes

#### Question Substitution
> Substitution of questions inevitably produces systematic errors.

#### Intuition
> Sometimes intuition beats logic even when the correct answer stares you in the face.

#### Biases
> Awareness of your own biases can contribute to peace in marriages, and probably in other joint projects.

#### When it comes to predictions
> The illusion that we understand the past follows overconfidence in our ability to predict the future.

> People who spend their time, and earn their living, studying a particular topic produce poorer predictions than dart-throwing monkeys who would have distributed their choices evenly over the options. Even in the region they knew best, experts were not significantly better than nonspecialists.

> Those with the most knowledge are often less reliable. The reason is that the person who acquires more knowledge develops an enhanced illusion of [their] skill and becomes unrealistically confident

> The line that separates the possibly predictable future from the unpredictable future is yet to be drawn.

#### Intuition vs Formulas (algorithms)
> The aversion to algorithms making decisions that affect humans is deeply rooted in the strong preference that many people have for the natural over the synthetic or artificial. Asked whether they would rather eat an organic or a commercially grown apple, most people prefer the ""all natural" one. Even after being informed that the two apples taste the same, have identical nutritional value, and are equally healthful, a majority still prefer the organic fruit. Even the producers of beer have found that they can increase sales by putting "All Natural" or "No preservatives" on the label.

> It is unethical to rely on intuitive judgements for important decisions if an algorithm is available that will make fewer mistakes.

> Do not simply trust intuitive judgement—your own or that of others—but do not dismiss it, either.

> Statistical algorithms greatly outdo humans in noisy environments for two reasons: they are more likely than human judges to detect weakly valid cues and much more likely to maintain a modest level of accuracy by using such cues consistently.

When should you trust someone's intuitions?
> If the environment is sufficiently regular and if the judge has had a chance to learn its regularities, the associative machinery will recognize situations and generate quick and accurate predictions and decisions. You can trust someone's intuitions if these conditions are met.

#### Decision making
> People's choices are based not on the dollar values but on the psychological values of outcomes, their utilities.

#### Theory-induced blindness
> Once you have accepted a theory and use it as a tool in your thinking, it is extraordinarily difficult to notice its flaws.
> If you come upon an observation that does not seem to fit the model, you assume that there must be a perfectly god explanation that you are somehow missing. You give the theory the benefit of the doubt, trusting the community of experts who have accepted it.

#### Prospect theory
> The reason you like the idea of gaining $100 and dislike the idea of losing $100 is not that these amounts change your wealth. You just like winning and dislike losing--and you almost certainly dislike losing more than you like winning.

#### The Endowment Effect
> Evidence from brain imaging confirms the difference. Selling goods that one would normally use activates regions of the brain that are associated with disgust and pain. Buying also activates these areas, but only when the prices are perceived as too high--when you feel that a seller is taking money that exceeds the exchange value. Brain recordings also indicate that buying at especially low prices is a pleasurable event.

#### Keeping Score
> Except for the very poor, for whom income coincides with survival, the main motivators of money-seeking are not necessarily economic. For the billionaire looking for the extra billion, and indeed for the participant in an experimental economics project looking for the extra dollar, money is a proxy for points on a scale of self-regard and achievement. These rewards and punishments, promises and threats, are all in our heads. We carefully keep score of them. They shape our preferences and motivate our actions, like the incentives provided in the social environment. As a result, we refuse to cut losses when doing so would admit failure, we are biased against actions that could lead to regret, and we draw an illusory but sharp distinction between omission and commission, not doing and doing, because the sense of responsibility is greater for one than for the other. The ultimate currency that rewards or punishes is often emotional, a form of mental self-dealing that inevitably creates conflicts of interest wen the individual acts as an agent on behalf of an organization.

> Hindsight is worse when you think a little, just enough to tell yourself later, "I almost made a better choice."

#### Frames and Reality
> It is often the case that when you broaden the frame, you reach more reasonable decisions.

> Reframing is effortful and System 2 is normally lazy. Unless there is an obvious reason to do otherwise, most of us passively accept decision problems as they are framed and therefore rarely have an opportunity to discover the extent to which our preferences are *frame-bound* rather than *reality-bound*.

> Your moral feelings are attached to frames, to descriptions of reality rather than to reality itself. The message about the nature of framing is stark: framing should not be viewed as an intervention that masks or distorts an underlying preference. ... Our preferences are about framed problems, and our moral intuitions are about descriptions, not about substance.

> Broader frames and inclusive accounts generally lead to more rational decisions.

#### Life as a Story
> Odd as it may seem, I am my remembering self, and the experiencing self, who does my living, is like a stranger to me.

> You seem to be devoting your entire vacation to the construction of memories. **Perhaps you should put away the camera and enjoy the moment, even if it is not very memorable?**

> She is an Alzheimer's patient. She no longer maintains a narrative of her life, but her experiencing self is still sensitive to beauty and gentleness.

#### Experienced Well-Being
> Our emotional state is largely determined by what we attend to, and we are normally focused on our current activity and immediate environment. There are exceptions, where the quality of subjective experience is dominated by recurrent thoughts rather than by the events of the moment. When happily in love, we may feel joy even when caught in traffic, and if grieving, we may remain depressed when watching a funny move.
<!-- In normal circumstances, however, we draw pleasure and pain from what is happening at the moment, if we attend to it -->

> The easiest way to increase happiness is to control your use of time

Can money buy happiness?

> The conclusion is that being poor makes one miserable, and that being rich may enhance one's life satisfaction, but does not (on average) improve experienced well-being.

> The satiation level beyond which experienced well-being no longer increases was a household income of about $75,000 in high-cost areas (it could be less in areas where the cost of living is lower). The average increase of experienced well-being associated with incomes beyond that level was precisely zero.

#### The Focusing Illusion
> Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.
