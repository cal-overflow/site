After reading two books on the world's favorite drug, Alcohol, I thought it was time to smarten-up with the controversial drug, Cannabis.

<!--more-->

The book takes a scientific look at the substance. Along the way, Author Leslie Iversen throws in the sociological impacts the substance has had, and may have in the future.

### Who should read this book?
Anyone who has interest in the topic of marijuana. It shines a perspective on both the potential benefits and drawbacks of consumption, both culturally and at an individual level.

**This is a must-read for:** Heavy marijuana users and anyone who is completely anti-weed.

## Note

I wasn't super invested in note-taking while reading this book. The quotes below are pretty interesting, though.

## Quotes

#### Violence
> There is not any significant evidence that the drug inspires violence--on the contrary, it tends to cause somnolence and lethargy when taken in high doses.

> The peak of intoxication may be associated with hallucinations (i.e., seeing and hearing things that are not there). Cannabis does not induce the powerful visual hallucinations that characterize the drug lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), but fleeting hallucinations can occur, usually in the visual domain.

#### Alcohol and Marijuana
> Alcohol could be described as the intoxicant for the older generation and marijuana that for the young, although both drugs are quite often consumed together.

> Whereas marijuana tends to make users relaxed and tranquil, alcohol may release aggressive and violent behavior. In terms of the long-term effects of chronic use, alcohol has none of the subtlety of marijuana. Heavy long-term use can lead to organic brain damage and psychosis or dementia (a condition known as Korsakoff syndrome), while even moderately heavy use can lead to quite severe persistent intellectual impairment.

#### Driving while high
> Many studies revealed only relatively small impairments in driving skills, even after quite large doses of the drug... \
> Nevertheless, driving while under the influence of marijuana cannot be recommended as safe.

#### Tolerance and withdrawal
> Tolerance seems only likely to become important for heavy users who are taking gram quantities of resin on a daily basis.

> It used to be thought that cessation of cannabis use was not associated with withdrawal in human users, but carefully controlled studies have shown that a reliable and clinically significant withdrawal syndrome does occur. The symptoms include craving for cannabis, decreased appetite, sleep difficulty, and weight loss, and the syndrome may sometimes be accompanied by anger, aggression, increased irritability, restlessness, and strange dreams

#### Drug safety
> By any standards, THC must be considered to be a very safe drug both acutely and on long-term exposure. The very low lethality of the drug may reflect the fact that cannabinoid receptors are virtually absent from those regions at the base of the brain that are responsible for such vital functions as breathing and blood pressure control. The available animal data are more than adequate to justify its approval as a human medicine, and indeed it has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for certain limited therapeutic indications.
