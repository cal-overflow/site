## Quotes

### The Major Ways Alcohol Affects Your Length of Life
#### Liver
> Alcohol is a poison, and the liver is in charge of breaking down poisons, as well as other drugs and chemicals. That's why alcohol, like other poisons, can destroy your liver. The problem is, most people don't know they have liver damage until it's very advanced--and possibly too late.

> Binge drinking is particularly dangerous because when the liver dies, you tend to die. The only way to recover from it is by having a liver transplant.

#### Cirrhosis
> Daily drinkers have a higher risk of cirrhosis than non-daily drinkers, and women who drink mainly with meals have a lower risk than those who drink without food. 13 It also seems that women may be more susceptible to the toxic effects of alcohol on the liver.

#### Brain
> This may shock you, but drinking causes brain damage.

### How much alcohol should you consume?
> When it comes to all drugs, including alcohol--and in fact all risky activities--less is always safer. Looking at the statistics, if you want to maximize your life, the rule would be not to drink a drop. \
> The same goes for if you want to maximize your health: don't drink at all--because there are no health benefits to it.

> If you do drink in order to get drunk, start to take cutting down very seriously.

> If you're drinking sensibly you're very likely to have two drinks at the most, so you should be able to count them!


### Consequences of drinking
> The strength of the alcohol you're drinking also matters in this respect; the faster you are able to get drunk, the more quickly bad things start to happen.

> People do a lot of stupid things when they are drunk. It's a lethal combination: Alcohol helps you shed your fear but also your judgment.

> Alcohol makes you--whether you're a man or a woman--more vulnerable to becoming a victim. You're not as aware of the threats as you would be when sober and are less able to defend yourself if you are attacked.

### How to prevent a hangover
> 1. **DRINK LESS.** You know this already.
> 1. **PACE YOURSELF.** It takes about 1.5 hours for you to process one standard drink. Drink slowly and you will have a chance to process the alcohol, which means your blood alcohol peak won't be as high, which has been shown to give less of a hangover.
> 1. **DRINK WATER WITH YOUR ALCOHOLIC DRINKS.** Other wan to dilute are to add more ice, add soda to wine or lemonade to beer, or have more mixers with spirits. Nota bene: flat is better as fizzy drinks may make you absorb alcohol faster.
> 1. **DRINK SMALLER MEASURES.** Shrinking your glass means less booze over the course of an evening.
> 1. **DRINK CLEAR SPIRITS.** They contain fewer congeners, which are thought to make hangovers worse. One study showed that vodka produced a lesser hangover than whiskey, for example (although both the vodka and whiskey drinkers' sleep and next-day concentration were bad).
