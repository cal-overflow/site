After reading *[The SLEEP Prescription](/books/the-sleep-prescription)*, I noticed that there were two other books in the "prescription" series. Although it wasn't a priority read, I couldn't resist picking up this book when I saw it at my local bookstore.

*The STRESS Prescription* is a wonderful exploration of stress and the role it plays in our everyday lives.

My largest takeaways from this book are that the following are incredible for managing stress.
- Exercise (physical exertion)
- Deep rest (sleep, obviously)
- Spending time outside (in actual nature, not just on the sidewalk outside your home)
- Meditation
- Breathing properly
- Posture

### Who should read this book?
Everyone should read this book to better understand their relationship with stress.

**This is a must-read for:** Anyone who has issues with stress, anxiety, or feels overwhelmed by the chaos of life.

## Quotes

### The dangers of stress
> Chronic stress, the type that goes on for years and years, has a toxic effect on your body. It wears out your cells prematurely.

### Reality
> Constant checking is not a good way to deal with uncertainty about the world.

> Most of us are not regularly being chased by life-threatening lions. But our bodies are behaving as though we are. Too often, we're responding to the stressors that pop up over the course of a day as though they're a survival threat to fight off or run from, rather than a meal to take down.

> Accept and adapt. Don't fight against circumstances you can't control. Accept reality, adapt quickly, and problem-solve from there.

### Exercise
> ### Stress Your Body Out On Purpose
> Here's what we know. When it comes to triggering hormesis in the body, exercise--any physical activity-works. It's the longstanding classic. But we now know that very brief bouts of physical activity-like high-intensity interval training-will also trigger this beneficial recovery process.

### Touch grass ðŸŒ¿
> Exposure to nature, in all forms and contexts, is one of the most powerful and immediate ways to shrink stress.

### Rest
> Rest, it seems, should be the easiest thing to do--natural, effortless, automatic--but it's actually one of the most challenging. The idea of taking time out is hard, and the idea of "doing nothing" is even harder. As much as we might love to, we can't just plop down on the couch and quickly achieve deep rest. Our minds and bodies just don't downshift that quickly and easily. So it's certain activities like mind-body practices that really help us get there.

> Countering stress every day is tending to our wellness, our quality of life, and our ability to make an impact in the world in some capacity--whatever our sphere of influence may be. If you don't put in the time for self-care, including deep rest now, you'll be forced to make time for illness later.

### Meditation
> My colleagues and I ran a study in which we recruited women who had never meditated before, and split them into two groups. The control group was sent on a one-week vacation at a luxury resort where they could swim, take walks, and relax. The other group stayed at the same resort--but for eight hours a day they practiced mantra meditation, yoga, and self-reflection exercises. We wanted to know: Does a long, relaxing break mitigate stress just as much as contemplative practices? Or does meditation really do something more? \
> At the end of the week, everybody had indeed benefited-all the women felt fabulous. They reported dramatic improvements in feelings of vitality as well as decreases in stress and depression. (No surprise, really, that the human nervous system does well at a beautiful resort, whether you're meditating or not!) But when we followed up almost one year later, the groups had diverged in their well-being. The control group had bounced right back up to their pre-vacation levels of stress and depression--it was as though the break had never happened. Meanwhile, the meditation group had actually maintained their lower levels of stress and depression a year later. Some of the women had kept up the practice, but that didn't fully explain the positive results across the group. We think that even a short meditation training can leave us with a different mental filter, a new awareness of how our mind works, and the capacity to recognize our thoughts as just thoughts--fleeting observations rather than real events or true statements--draining them of their power to trigger an unnecessary stress response. This ability to observe our mind is called *metacognition*.

### Breathing
> Breathing, it turns out, can be the quickest, most direct path to deep rest. When you can't go to a retreat, you can bring the retreat to you. And all you need is your breath.

> By altering our breath, we also influence our emotional state, pushing us toward calm, joy, and equanimity.

### Pursuit of happiness
> Surveys reveal that people who actively pursue happiness, overvalue the idea of happiness, or believe they should be happy most of the time are some of the unhappiest people.
