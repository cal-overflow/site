Before reading this book, I was extremely **anti-alcohol**. \
Sure, I had "fun" drinking in my past. However, I quickly outgrew this (what I now consider childish) phase and viewed alcohol as nothing but poison.

Although this book doesn't disarm the argument against alcohol, it does provide a detailed historical lens on the topic.
<!--more-->

In regards to my view on alcohol: I am no longer completely abstinent. However, I drink only on rare occasions.

Immediately after finishing *Drunk*, I read *Drink?*, which dives further into the health consequences of alcohol consumption. I highly recommend reading that book (or [my notes on it](/books/drink)) if you would like to make the most informed decision surrounding alcohol consumption.

### Who should read this book?
Anyone who wants to better understand Alcohol should read this book. It's very insightful and provides much context into the history of the world's favorite drug.

**This is a must-read for:** Nobody. It's a great read, though.

## Notes

### *in vino veritas*
Latin for "in wine there is truth."

### BAC
Blood Alcohol Content \
The percentage of alcohol in a person's bloodstream.

### Distillation
Before distillation, traditionally fermented drinks (beer and wine) were the primary method of consuming alcohol. Distillation changed this drastically. \
Through distillation, liquor is created, and contains a far higher percentage of alcohol. **Hence, Liquor is far more dangerous than beer or wine.**

Be cautious of liquor and its strength. Drinking liquor can be summarized as launching people into the depressing (beyond ~0.08 BAC) effects of Alcohol, skipping over the lighter, more "euphoric," less dangerous stages.

### Drinking alone
Don't drink alone.

### Drinking at home
If possible, don't drink in your own home. The ability to do so is relatively new. In the past, drinking alcohol was primarily limited to bars/pubs or other public settings.

If you are ever drinking in your own home, constrain it to special holidays/occasions. Furthermore, limit this consumption to certain areas of the house (i.e., only allow drinking at the dinner table).

## Quotes

### The love for intoxication
> We are apes built to get high

> All over the world, wherever you find people, you find ridiculous amounts of time, wealth, and effort dedicated to the sole purpose of getting high... Even ancient dead people were obsessed with getting wasted. It is hard to find a culture that did not send off their dead with copious quantities of alcohol, cannabis, or other intoxicants.

> Given the social costs of alcohol and other chemical intoxicants--domestic abuse, drunken brawling, wasted resources, hungover and useless soldiers and workers--why has the production and consumption of alcohol and similar substances remained at the heart of human social life?

> When it comes to market economies, contemporary households around the world officially report spending on alcohol and cigarettes at least a third of what they spend on *food*; in some countries (Ireland, Czech Republic) this rises to a half or more.

> If intoxication had overall negative effects on cultural groups, we would expect anti-intoxicant norms to become universal, especially since cultural evolution moves much faster than genetic evolution.
> Intoxication is performing a crucial functional role in society. This would make it resistant to being eliminated by cultural fiat, and would create a vacuum that needs to be filled in the rare cases where it is genuinely taken out of the picture.


> There is a very good reason we have historically gotten drunk. It is no accident that, in the brutal competition of cultural groups from which civilizations emerged, it is the drinkers, smokers, and trippers who emerged triumphant. In all of the was outlined above, intoxicants--above all alcohol--appear to have been the chemical tool that allowed humans to escape the limits imposed by our ape nature and create social insect-like levels of cooperation.

### Culture
> Humans have become so dependent upon culture that we can no longer live without it.

### The consequences of intoxication
> Descriptions and visual depictions of alcohol-fueled rituals and banquets from ancient Egypt to China make it clear that disorder, fighting, illness, poorly timed unconsciousness, copious vomiting, and illicit sex have long been common outcomes of alcohol consumption.

> Large-scale epidemiological studies show that moderate alcohol consumption, as opposed to both complete abstinence and heavy drinking, is associated with closer friendships and better family support

### Sake and Sushi
> Even in the weaker forms typically consumed by humans, it appears to retain some anti-microbial and anti-parasitic properties. This is why it's not a bad idea to drink when you have sushi: Washing down the raw fish with sake might help kill any nasty bugs that came along for the ride.

### Prefrontal cortex
> The prefrontal cortex is a physiologically expensive bit of machinery, and we evolved it for a reason. The ability to remain task-focused, repress emotions, and delay gratification is a crucial human trait. We cannot remain children forever.

> Drunk people perform on [many tasks] as if they had prefrontal cortex damage. They continue to stubbornly plunge ahead in the face of negative feedback.

> If we want to enhance mood and temporarily take the prefrontal cortex offline, a delicious liquid neurotoxin [Alcohol] seems to be the fastest and most pleasant option.

### Societal impact
> If your goal is to maximize implementable cultural innovation, your ideal person would be someone with the body of an adult but, for a brief period, the mind of a child. Someone with downregulated cognitive control, heightened openness to experience, and a mind prone to wander off in unpredictable directions. In other words, a drunk, stoned, or tripping adult.

> There are many ways humans can achieve a hive mind, but liquor is certainly the quickest.

### Hallucinogens
> Modern science has given us the ability to purify the active ingredients in traditional psychedelics and deliver them in precise doses. If, eventually, this makes these drugs more amenable to everyday use, they might offer considerable advantages over alcohol. Despite lurid reports in the 1960s about LSD-induced insanity or tripping teenagers leaping off roofs, psychedelics are considerably safer, in most regards, than alcohol or cannabis. They are non-addictive, selectively target certain parts of the brain rather than playing havoc with the entire brain-body system, and cause no known side effects.


### Alcohol in the Modern World
> Knocking back a string of high-alcohol beers or vodka and tonics in front of the IV, even with one's family around, is a radical departure from traditional drinking practices centered on communal meals and ritually paced toasting.

> It is almost certainly the case that throwing large groups of already prefrontally challenged young people into house or frat parties with music, dancing, and massive quantities of distilled liquor served in opaque red plastic cups is a recipe for trouble.

### The dangers of distillation (liquors)
> It is quite possible that distilled liquor is such a novel threat that genetic evolution simply hasn't had time to catch up.

### Miscellaneous
> We get drunk because we are a weird species, the awkward losers of the animal world, and need all of the help we can get.

> Whether literally or spiritually, from time to time, we *need* to get drunk.

> We are an odd, sad species of ape, trying to make our way in societies organized on a scale we are not genetically equipped to negotiate. The discovery of a liquid neurotoxin that helps us to be more creative, culturally connected, and communally trusting was a crucial stage in our evolution, and we need to better understand how intoxicants continue to function for us today. But let us never lose sight of the fact that drinking, or smoking, or taking an occasional mushroom trip is primordially, atavistically *fun*. Let us flash our eyes and drink the milk of Paradise. Let us be not afraid to get drunk "in a primary way," for this is what reconnects us to the flow of experience that other animals get to simply take for granted.

> Alcohol is the only drug, besides pure stimulants like meth, that is known to increase physical aggression and violence. Cannabis. kava, MDMA, and psychedelics all produce either mellow or introverted highs. Alcohol's stimulating effect, when combined with cognitive myopia and loss of executive function, can induce aggressive or violent behavior, especially in people with already low levels of cognitive control.
