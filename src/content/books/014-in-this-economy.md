> People are the economy

That's what economist and author Kyla Scanlon writes in her book *In this Economy?*.

The book is a fresh take on economics, and hopefully a great introduction for many Zoomers[^1] like myself who want to see an economic change in the world.

Although I disagree with a couple points in this book (mostly regarding the job market post-Covid and strict use of the term *recession*), the overall teachings of the book are undeniably accurate.

### Who should read this book?
Scanlon does an incredible job simplifying complex topics. Her explanations are great for people who don't have much background on economics, meaning this a great start for people interested in the topic.

**This is a must-read for:** People interested in and new to Economics.

## Notes

- People are the economy
- The economy is just vibes

#### Universal healthcare
A common argument against universal healthcare (from conservatives) is that "I don't want to pay for someone else's healthcare." However, we're all already doing that by paying into our health insurance provider's pool of cash.

## Quotes

### Third places + the internet
> This all happens because we feel like we are running out of time, running out of money, running out of space to think. There have been many efforts to make the internet into a third place, and it is, in a way. But you still log off eventually. you put down the phone or close out the tab on the computer and it's still you, rattling around, somatically (soulfully?) alone.

### Greed + Monopolies
> Companies usually raise prices when they can, which has a lot of consequences. NestlÃ©, Coca-Cola, and other companies raised their prices by more than 10 percent in the first quarter (first three months) of 2023. And it's very easy for them, since power is so consolidated. After all:
> - Four companies control 85 percent of the U.S. beef market
> - Four companies control 80 percent of the U.S. soy market
> - Three companies control 78 percent of the U.S. pasta market
> - Three companies control 72 percent of the U.S. cereal market

> - George Bernard Shaw

> Satisfaction with family life and health are the strongest predictors while satisfaction with income and leisure time are the weakest predictors of overall life satisfaction for both genders.

> A passage in Karl Marx's *Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844* expands on the above idea--that as we talk about the economy, it's good to reflect on human well-being:
> > The less you eat, drink and read books; the less you go to the theatre, the dance hall, the public house; the less you think, love theorize, sing, paint, fence, etc., the more you save--the greater becomes your treasure which neither moths nor dust will devour your capital. The less you are, the more you have; The less you express your own life, the greater is your alienated life--the greater is the store of your estranged being.

I'd like to highlight the important summary within the quote from Marx.
> The less you are, the more you have


She quotes Toni Morrison's *The Source of Self-Regard*:
> Fascism talks ideology, but it is really just marketing--marketing for power. It is recognizable by its need to purge, by the strategies it uses to purge, and by its terror of truly democratic agendas. It is recognizable by its determination to convert all public services to private entrepreneurship, all nonprofit organizations to profit-making ones--so that the narrow but protective chasm between governance and business disappears. It changes citizens into taxpayers--so individuals become angry at even the notion of the public good. It changes neighbors into consumers--so the measure of our value as humans is not our humanity or our compassion or our generosity but what we own. It changes parenting into panicking--so that we vote against the interests of our own children; against their health care, their education, their safety from weapons. And in effecting these changes it produces the perfect capitalist, one who is willing to kill a human being for a product (a pair of sneakers, a jacket, a car) or kill generations for control of products (oil, drugs, fruit, gold).
