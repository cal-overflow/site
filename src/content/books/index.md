  <summary>Books I've decided against reading</summary>

  #### Self-Help
  AKA **systemic issues** sold to us as individualistic issues we must fix.
  - Deep work (Cal Newport)
  - How to win friends and influence people (Dale Carnegie)
  - I used to me a miserable F\*\*\* (John Kim)

  - The compound effect (Darren Hardy)
  - The power of habit (Charles Duhigg)

  #### Already researched
  These I decided not to read after doing other research on the topic (i.e., other books)

  - Vanderbilt: The Rise and Fall of an American (Anderson Cooper & Katherine Howe)

  #### Disproven
  - The interpretation of dreams (Sigmund Freud) 

  #### Software engineering
  If we're being honest with ourselves, these books teach old or basic practices and provide almost no real value.
  - A Philosophy of Software Design (John Ousterhout)
