Welcome to my book section! \
In this section I discuss the books I've read and give my recommendations.

<divider></divider>

### Must-read books 👀
These books either offered a new perspective on a topic or were just really enjoyable to read!
- [The defining decade](/books/the-defining-decade)
- [Why we sleep](/books/why-we-sleep)
- [Thinking, Fast and slow](/books/thinking-fast-and-slow)

### What I'm planning to read next 📚
- The basics of bitcoin and blockchains <!-- Currently reading - I don't know anything about crypto 🙈 -->
- Behold the pale horse <!-- A friend recommended this to me. Not sure what to expect -->
- The art of not giving a f***
- Everything is f***ed
- The 7 habits of highly effective people
- The art of talking to anyone
- The interpretation of dreams (Sigmund Freud)
- Bowling alone
<!--
Regarding the next four books:
1. I'm not an alcoholic lol. I'm actually rather "anti-alcohol."
2. I'm unsure where I stand regarding Marijuana use.
3. I do like coffee, but I don't know how I should feel about caffeine.
I simply want to understand and be educated on these substances, as they are widely used throughout society
