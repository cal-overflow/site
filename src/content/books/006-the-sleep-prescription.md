I know what you're thinking: ***Why the hell does this guy care so much about sleep?***

To answer, I'll share a quote from this very book:
> Your sleep is an investment in your future productivity, creativity, and happiness.

<!--more-->

Although this book is written as a guide for those suffering from sleep problems (such as insomnia), it is incredibly insightful to just about anyone who sleeps. Oh wait, that's everyone!

<small>

The purpose of this book isn't to teach us why we sleep. For more on that, see [Why We Sleep](/books/why-we-sleep).

### Who should read this book?
I think that everyone should read this book to know how they might improve their sleep.

**This is a must-read for:** anyone who has a poor relationship with sleep.

## Notes

### Nervous Systems
#### Sympathetic Nervous System
This is the "fight or flight" nervous system. \
This system is triggered by stress.

#### Parasympathetic Nervous System
This is the system that allows us to relax. \
This system helps the body enter a calm and relaxed state (such as sleep).

### Sleep Opportunity
The period of time from when you first get into bed at night to when you wake up for the last time in morning.

### Sleep Efficiency
How much time you spend actually asleep compared to how much time you give yourself to sleep (sleep opportunity).

### Winding down
Ideally, give yourself two hours of time to wind down before bed. \
Obviously, if you are sleepy before or during your wind down activity, cutting it short is perfectly fine.

#### Example wind down activities:
- Dim the lights
- Taking a bath or shower
- Reading a book
- Listening to a podcast
- Meditation

#### Activities to avoid before bed:
- Work <small>(MOST IMPORTANT)</small>
- Social Media
- Screens <small>(as much as possible)</small>
- Drinking


### The importance of your bed
If you condition yourself correctly, your bed can be a sleep trigger.

## Quotes

> Your sleep is an investment in your future productivity, creativity, and happiness.

> We live in a society where we've glamorized short sleep and long work hours.

> We elevate productivity and devalue rest. Which is ironic, because *rest* is what we most need in order to be productive, creative, effective, innovative.

> Simple and sugary carbs (think pizza, white bread, bagels, pasta) can cause more wake ups throughout the night. In contrast, complex carbs (again, these are the more high-fiber foods like sweet potatoes, oatmeal, and whole grains) can stabilize your sleep patterns--possibly.

> The takeaway? Your sleep has a huge impact on your relationships with the people closest to you.

### Prednisone
> We know that people who receive high doses of steroids (like prednisone) are frequently pushed into insomnia, cortisol is actually a normal steroid.

### Stress
> If we're carrying around a lot of stress, it's hard to disengage the sympathetic and amp up the parasympathetic at bedtime--we're just *on*, we feel wired not tired. **And it doesn't have to be some catastrophic stressor for this to happen: just the simple stress of working right up until bedtime can cause this. The energy that's required is just not compatible with sleep.**

> When your sleep schedule--and your day schedule--is unstructured, your body doesn't know what's coming. It doesn't get the cues it needs to turn down the stress system and turn up the melatonin. Confused about what it's supposed to be doing at any given time, your system doesn't wind down and prepare for sleep--it just keeps going with the shots of energy-producing cortisol, keeping you energized for the workday it believes is still happening.

### Meditation
>  Some people hate hearing advice to meditate-it does seem to be everywhere these days -but there's a reason for that. It works. Research shows that mindfulness meditation can provide some of the same restorative benefits as sleep does. How do we know?
> It turns out that people who meditate regularly (and who have done so long-term) also get less sleep at night. 14 The theory: they may actually need less sleep, due to processes in the brain during meditation that mimic certain processes during sleep. Meditation, for many, may relieve stress, and it may offer a small dose of the same kind of restoration you get with sleep.

### Winding down
> A lot of the time, what we really need is to learn how to get out of our own way. And that means setting aside, and then ferociously protecting the time it takes to transition from awake to asleep.

> For the vast majority of people with insomnia struggles, the biggest challenge is behavioral. It's our habit to work late. It's our routine to scroll on the phone. We have entrenched beliefs that we should be busy and productive. When that wind-down alarm goes off, our instinct is to rationalize and say, "Tonight I need to keep working (or doing Ã—); it's too important." So when your phone buzzes you that it's wind-down time tonight, and every night this week, I want you to remind yourself that this wind-down time is in service of better sleep. And with better sleep, you have better learning, creativity, attention, and memory. You can task-switch more smoothly and efficiently. You're better at emotional regulation.

### Bed
> ### MAKE YOUR BED THE SLEEP TRIGGER
> #### Rule #1: Do Not Get into Your Bed Until You're Sleepy

> #### Rule #2: Don't Do Other Things in Your Bed
> No phone, no laptop, no book. Bed is for sleep and sex only.

> #### Rule #4: If You're Up, Get Up!
