When I first saw this book, I was surprised by its odd shape and short page count.

Although it's not like most of the books I've picked up, *Show Your Work!* is an incredible read.

<!--more-->

The book chapters alone are captivating. I've listed them below.
1. You don't have to be a genius.
1. Think process, not product.
1. Share something small every day.
1. Open up about your cabinet of curiosities.
1. Tell good stories.
1. Teach what you know.
1. Don't turn into human spam.
1. Learn to take a punch.
1. Sell out.
1. Stick around.

I don't have too much to add to this. I'll just throw some quotes/headlines from the book below.
