I'll be honest. I did not think I was going to like this book. I thought it was going to be one of those in-your-face "how to not care about stupid shit" books. **I'm happy to admit that this was a completely wrong assumption.**

<!--more-->

Mark Manson has a truly captivating way with words. Manson covers countless differing topics from the cultural shift in the Japan after WWII to romantic relationships to his fictional "disappointment panda" companion. Along the way, Manson frequently hooks your attention with over-the-top (and funny) jokes and stories.

#### So... What the fuck is the book about?
Really, the book is about what the title says; not giving a fuck. I was happily surprised to see the book cover all sorts of topics, from incredible moments in history to recent discoveries in the field of psychology.

A few parts of this book gave be subtle flashbacks to *[Thinking, Fast and Slow](/books/thinking-fast-and-slow)*, which is one of my favorite psychology books (though, Manson definitely takes a less scientific approach in his writing).

### Who should read this book?
Everyone.

**This is a must-read for:** New readers or People looking for a new perspective on life.

## Quotes
### General
> You can't win if you don't play.

> Action isn't just the effect of motivation; it's also the cause of it.

> We shouldn't seek to find the ultimate "right" answer for ourselves, but rather, we should seek to chip away at the ways that we're wrong today so that we can be a little less wrong tomorrow.

> #### The Tyranny of Exceptionalism
> Most of us are pretty average at most things we do. Even if you're exceptional at one thing, chances are you're average or below average at most other things. That's just the nature of life. To become truly great at something, you have to dedicate shit-tons of time and energy to it. And because we all have limited time and energy, few of us ever become truly exceptional at more than one thing, if anything at all.

> This confines us and stifles us. We can be truly successful only at something we're willing to fail at. If we're unwilling to fail, then we're unwilling to succeed.

### Problems
> Whatever your problems are, the concept is the same: solve problems; be happy. Unfortunately, for many people, life doesn't feel that simple. That's because they fuck things up in at least one of two ways:
> 1. *Denial.* Some people deny that their problems exist in the first place. And because they deny reality, they must constantly delude or distract themselves from reality. This may make them feel good in the short term, but it leads to a life of insecurity, neuroticism, and emotional repression.
> 1. *Victim Mentality.* Some choose to believe that there is nothing they can do to solve their problems, even when they in fact could. Victims seek to blame others for their problems or blame outside circumstances. This may make them feel better in the short term, but it leads to a life of anger, helplessness, and despair.

> What is objectively true about your situation is not as important as how you come to see the situation, how you choose to measure it and value it. Problems may be inevitable, but the *meaning* of each problem is not. We get to control what our problems mean based on how we choose to think about them, the standard by which we choose to measure them.

### Emotions
> Negative emotions are a *call to action.* When you feel them, it's because you're supposed to *do something*. Positive emotions, on the other hand, are rewards for taking the proper action. When you feel them, life seems simple and there is nothing else to do but enjoy it. Then, like everything else, the positive emotions go away, because more problems inevitably emerge.

> We all have emotional blind spots. Often they have to do with the emotions that we were taught were inappropriate growing up. It takes years of practice and effort to get good at identifying blind spots in ourselves and then expressing the affected emotions appropriately. But this task is hugely important, and worth the effort.

> The ticket to emotional health, like that to physical health, comes from eating your veggies that is, accepting the bland and mundane truths of life: truths such as "Your actions actually don't matter *that much* in the grand scheme of things" and "The vast majority of your life will be boring and not noteworthy, and that's okay?" This vegetable course will taste bad at first. Very bad. You will avoid accepting it. \
> But once ingested, your body will wake up feeling more potent and more alive. After all, that constant pressure to be something amazing, to be the next big thing, will be lifted off your back. The stress and anxiety of always feeling inadequate and constantly needing to prove yourself will dissipate. And the knowledge and acceptance of your own mundane existence will actually free you to accomplish what you truly wish to accomplish, without judgment or lofty expectations.

### Entitlement
> Entitlement is impervious. People who are entitled delude themselves into whatever feeds their sense of superiority. They keep their mental facade standing at all costs, even if it sometimes requires being physically or emotionally abusive to those around them.

> The rare people who do become truly exceptional at something do so not because they believe they're exceptional. On the contrary, they become amazing because they're obsessed with improvement. And that obsession with improvement stems from an unerring belief that they are, in fact, not that great at all. It's *anti*-entitlement. People who become great at something become great because they understand that they're not already great-they are mediocre, they are average and that they could be so much better,

> The desire to avoid rejection at all costs, to avoid confrontation and conflict, the desire to attempt to accept everything equally and to make everything cohere and harmonize, is a deep and subtle form of entitlement. Entitled people, because they feel as though they *deserve* to feel great all the time, avoid rejecting anything because doing so might make them or someone else feel bad. And because they refuse to reject anything, they live a valueless, pleasure-driven, and self-absorbed life. All they give a fuck about is sustaining the high a little bit longer, to avoid the inevitable failures of their life, to pretend the suffering away.

> As alluring as it is, entitlement isolates us. Our curiosity and excitement for the world turns in upon itself and reflects our own biases and projections onto every person we meet and every event we experience. This feels sexy and enticing and may feel good for a while and sells a lot of tickets, but it's spiritual poison.

### Relationships
> Without conflict, there can be no trust. Conflict exists to show us who is there for us unconditionally and who is just there for the benefits.

#### Entitlement & Toxicity in relationships
> [The relationships of entitled people] are fragile and fake, products of avoiding inner pain rather than embracing a genuine appreciation and adoration of their partner.

Here's a long one.

> Entitled people who blame others for their own emotions and actions do so because they believe that if they constantly paint themselves as victims, eventually someone will come along and save them, and they will receive the love they've always wanted. \
> Entitled people who take the blame for other people's emotions and actions do so because they believe that if they "fix" their partner and save him or her, they will receive the love and appreciation they've always wanted. \
> These are the yin and yang of any toxic relationship: the victim and the saver, the person who starts fires because it makes her feel important and the person who puts out fires because it makes him feel important. \
> These two types of people are drawn strongly to one an-other, and they usually end up together. Their pathologies match one another perfectly. Often they've grown up with parents who each exhibit one of these traits as well. So their model for a "happy" relationship is one based on entitlement and poor boundaries. \
> Sadly, they both fail in meeting the other's actual needs. In fact, their pattern of overblaming and overaccepting blame perpetuates the entitlement and shitty self-worth that have been keeping them from getting their emotional needs met in the first place. The victim creates more and more problems to solve--not because additional real problems exist, but because it gets her the attention and affection she craves. The saver solves and solves--not because she actually cares about the problems, but because she believes she must fix others' problems in order to deserve attention and affection for herself. In both cases, the intentions are selfish and conditional and therefore self-sabotaging, and genuine love is rarely experienced.

> Instead, victims and savers both use each other to achieve emotional highs. It's like an addiction they fulfill in one an-other. Ironically, when presented with emotionally healthy people to date, they usually feel bored or lack "chemistry" with them. They pass on emotionally healthy, secure individuals because the secure partner's solid boundaries don't feel "exciting" enough to stimulate the constant highs necessary in the entitled person.


### Avoidance
> The more something threatens to change how you view yourself, how successful/unsuccessful you believe yourself to be, how well you see yourself living up to your values, the more you will avoid ever getting around to doing it.

### Miscellaneous
> Technology has solved old economic problems by giving us new psychological problems. The Internet has not just open-sourced information; it has also open-sourced insecurity, self-doubt, and shame.

> #### The Self-Awareness Onion
> Self-awareness is like an onion. There are multiple layers to it, and the more you peel them back, the more likely you're going to start crying at inappropriate times.
