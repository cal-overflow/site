## Notes

### Basics
#### Blockchains
Replicated databases that act as the ultimate books and records--the 'golden source' that represents the universal understanding of the current status of all units of the digital asset.

#### The three functions of money
1. **Medium of exchange** means it is a payment mechanism. Must be widely accepted.
1. **Store of value** means that money will (in the near term) be worth relatively the same quantitative value.
1. **Unit of account** means it can be used as a quantitative value assessment (scale) for services/goods.


## Quotes
#### Bitcoin
> Bitcoin *protocols* are written out as Bitcoin *code* which is run as Bitcoin *software* which creates Bitcoin *transactions* containing data about Bitcoin *coins* recorded on Bitcoin's *blockchain*. Got it? Good.

> Bitcoin is the very first digital asset of value that can be transferred over the internet without any specific third party having to approve the transaction or be able to deny it.

### Money
#### Is Today's Money Good Money?
> According to the St Louis Fed, the purchasing power of the USD from a consumer's perspective has fallen by over 96% since the Federal Reserve System was created in 1913.

> The debasement of all forms of money that is not commodity money seems to be a common theme in the history of money.

> In terms of the 'store of value' function of money, it is more the short-term predictability of value, or spending power, that is relevant: I need to know that a dollar tomorrow or next month can buy me more or less the same thing as a dollar today and will settle immediate debts. But for long term preservation of value, perhaps housing or land or other assets may be more reliable.

> Stability is determined more by the *liquidity* of a market (how many people are willing to buy and sell at any price point), than the *price* of an asset.

> Pegs always eventually break.
