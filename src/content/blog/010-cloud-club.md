If you've read my recent posts, you'll know I'm obsessed with the [cloud](/cloud). I'm also incredibly saddened by the lack of coverage of Cloud Computing in academic environments.

That's why I started the Cloud Club at my university.

Another major reason I wanted to start the club was that I was never a fan of any other clubs offered at my university. I went to a few but often felt like the meetings were intended to sell members on something[^1] or just an excuse to keep everyone busy from doing something productive (such as side projects). \
I also needed another excuse to enhance my public speaking.

### Club meetings
At each club meeting, I wanted to provide a short presentation on a topic before allowing members to use a related Amazon Web Services (AWS) service.

Below are some of the topics we discussed with the respective AWS service we messed around with:

| Topic | Technology Used for hands-on activity |
| --: | :-: |
| Cloud Storage | AWS S3 |
| Access Management | AWS IAM |
| Cloud Computing | AWS EC2 |
| [Serverless Computing](/cloud/serverless) | AWS Lambda |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions |
| [Infrastructure as Code](/cloud/infrastructure-as-code) | AWS CloudFormation |
| Containerization | Docker |

### Where is the club now?
Unfortunately, many of the students that participated in the club were seniors. This means that we could not find enough students to lead the club the following year.

By no means was this club a failure. Although the club will not continue into the new academic year, I achieved what I originally wanted out of the club. I partook in public speaking--for a topic I am passionate about. Also, I inspired other club members to dive into AWS and experiment with the cloud.

### Club material
See the presentations for the club [here](https://github.com/cal-overflow/cloud-club).

[^1]: Many of the clubs I went to had guest speakers that would explain why you should come to work for their company. It wasn't very often that a club would provide something valuable (educational) or fun. \
      This is regarding tech-related clubs, of course.
