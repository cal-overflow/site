Computer Science 227 (Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming) is an introductory course at Iowa State University that teaches students the basics of object-oriented programming. The class challenges students to complete various assignments covering topics learned in class. Two of these assignments are described below.

### Major Topics Covered

- Objects, classes, methods, fields, and constructors
- Class inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, and abstract classes
- Iteration, recursion, searching, and sorting
- Debugging, exceptions, and exception handling

## Space Invaders

The final assignment in COM S 227 was to complete a nearly-finished Space Invaders game. Mostly all of the game had been written, excluding parts of the different SpaceShips, along with some game mechanics. Using a base (abstract class) SpaceShip, I created other SpaceShips (i.e. DefenderShip) that inherited the base spaceship. The use of class extension greatly reduced the use of repeating code for each type of ship.

## Maze

A path-finding program was given to me, and I was in charge of creating the program that converted an array of strings into a maze that consists of maze cells (objects). I achieved this by having each Maze contain a 2D array of Maze Cells. Each Maze Cell has many different properties to it, such as location, neighboring cells (accessible or inaccessible), the status (wall, unvisited, visited, etc.). View an image of an array of strings compared to the built maze [here](/blog-images/maze-construction.png).
