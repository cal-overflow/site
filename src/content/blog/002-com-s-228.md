### Prime Factorization

![Prime Factorization](/blog-images/prime-factorization.png)

After learning the basics of Nodes, Lists, and Iterators, I was tasked with an assignment that required all three to operate (specifically, doubly-linked-lists for the assignment). I constructed a nested Node and Prime Factorization class within the Prime Factorization class (a Prime Factorization is all of the prime factors that multiply to create a number. Example: the prime number `405` is equal to prime factors: `3^4 * 5`). I also constructed [JUnit test cases](https://github.com/cal-overflow/COM-S-228/blob/master/A3_PrimeFactorization/JUnitTests/hw3Tests.java) that I posted onto my class forum. My professor endorsed my test cases, and nearly 250 students used them as an aid to complete the assignment.

### Coordinate Points and Vectors

![Segments](/blog-images/segments.png)

A plotting program was given to me, and I was in charge of taking user data (Cartesian points), sorting it, and providing the sorted points and newly created vectors to be plotted. I created the program to use Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Selection Sort, showing the user the amount of time taken by each sorting method in each trial. I was also challenged to use anonymous classes for this project to “generate a comparator on the fly” ([see line 75 in Abstrct Sorter](https://github.com/cal-overflow/COM-S-228/blob/859ef5c9a9c53e52ac94c527a6ac11adf027c497/A2_CoordinatePointsAndVectors/src/hw2/AbstractSorter.java#L75)).
