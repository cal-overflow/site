If you read my [previous post](/blog/com-s-402), you'll know I didn't necessarily have the greatest experience in COM S 402. This was mostly because of the hardware limitations imposed upon my development team. More specifically, we weren't allowed to host our application in the cloud.

That's why I was surprised this last week to see a message from the course professor. He asked me to come share what I know about [cloud](/cloud).

This was my experience preparing and giving a Computer Science lecture.

### How did this happen?

**I am by no means a cloud expert.** As a matter of fact, I've only been learning Cloud for roughly a year now. However, when asked to share my knowledge with others, I didn't hesitate. <!--This is because of the serious lack of cloud courses offered at most universities. -->

Most students lack fundamental knowledge on cloud due to the lack of cloud courses offered. That, in addition to my passion for cloud and personal experience in 402, drove me to share my knowledge.<sup>◆</sup>

### What did I cover?

The professor gave me pretty much free reign when creating the material. His only request was that I include some sort of "hands-on" activity.

Luckily, I was able to re-use a lot of the material I had already created for Cloud Club.<sup>■</sup> Instead of diving deep into a specific cloud concept, I created an overview of what I believe to be the essential cloud concepts. I determined these to be:
1. Cloud Computing
1. Cloud Storage
    - File storage
    - Databases
1. [Infrastructure as Code](/cloud/infrastructure-as-code) (IaC)

### Hands-on activity
<!--With only an hour to work with, I decided to demonstrate the process of deploying a minimalistic project. This example project includes a static [React](https://reactjs.org/) frontend and a REST API containerized with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). -->

I created [this example 402 project](https://github.com/christianlisle/COM-S-402-example-project) which includes a frontend and an API, similar to most 402 projects. The idea was that students could fork the repository and deploy the frontend and backend stacks into AWS without needing to change any code or mess around in the console.

The main reason I did this was so that students could see IaC in action. There was only an hour to work with, so having students create their own CloudFormation templates wouldn't have made the most of the time. Instead, students saw how it took a matter of minutes to deploy a frontend and backend into the cloud.

#### Manual work
For the students who wanted to try this themselves, there was a small amount of manual work involved. I walked through the AWS console with the audience as we created an IAM Identity Provider and Role so that GitHub Actions could deploy to AWS as needed.
