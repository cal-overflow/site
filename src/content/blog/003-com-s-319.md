Computer Science 319 (Construction of User Interfaces) throws students into the world of Frontend development. The course challenges students to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, BootStrap, React, JavaFX, Node, and many other Frontend libraries and frameworks.

Although students are only shown the basics of most of these Frontend tools, students become quite familiar with Node and JavaScript in the class. In this post, I will describe my experience working on the final (group) project. My groupâ€™s project, CyRun, was an overall success.

For the last half of the semester, students were assigned a group project. My group, consisting of Joseph Dobosenski, Marissa Gustafson, and I, decided to create a multiplayer Pac-man game called CyRun. We decided to make a web-server (using Node, Express, and Socket.io) that hosts a website for the game. I was mostly responsible for the backend portion of the project. I developed and implemented: a real-time web app that users could join, handling player input, player movement, player direction changes, and player collision. I also dealt with optimizing the performance of the game.

### How I optimized CyRun

After creating a fully functional multiplayer Pacman game, our team soon realized that there was quite a lot of lag when multiple players moved. I reduced this lag by drastically reducing the size of packets emitted with every game update (~ every 200ms). This reduction was simple to implement: I only sent the walls (stationary items) to the clients at the beginning of the game. The client then remembers where each wall is and only needs to know what dynamic positions were updated. Reworking the gameboard to reduce the packet size drastically reduced the painful lag and allows for a smooth gameplay experience.

This video showcases the full experience of CyRun in its final state at the end of the Fall 2020 semester. The process of joining a lobby and playing a game with three other players is demonstrated.
