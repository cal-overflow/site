After taking a couple Web Design courses at my high school I decided to make my own website, not using WordPress or another website-building tool.

I moved away from using this website, because optimizing it for different types of browsers and devices took too much time and I have become accustomed to having WordPress do it for me. I switched to a WordPress site for my personal website in September of 2019, but I am still happy with how my old site looks, so I keep it hosted. Feel free to check it out.

**Built with:** HTML, CSS, & JavaScript
