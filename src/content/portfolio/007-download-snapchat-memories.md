## Download & launch the desktop application

### Download the application

Before you can download any of your photos or videos from Snapchat, you'll need to install the Snapchat memory downloader application on your computer. Navigate to [downloadmysnapchatmemories.com](https://www.downloadmysnapchatmemories.com) to download the application.

Select the operating system your device is running, and the application will begin downloading. Once the download is complete, you'll be ready to launch the application on your computer.

### Launch the application

Find the downloaded zip file on your computer. It will be located in your browser's default download folder. Unzip the folder so that you can find the app itself.

Next, you'll want to double-click on the **memory-download** executable file to launch the application. You'll likely see a prompt showing that the application is from an unrecognized developer. To override this message, see the directions below specific to your operating system.

#### Windows

Click the "More Info" button.

Once you're inside the Security and Privacy options pane, click the "Open Anyway" button next to the message saying the application is from an unidentified developer.

After the application has successfully launched on your computer, you're ready to use it to download your memories. Before you can download your memories, you must download your account data from Snapchat.

## Download your Snapchat data

The app downloaded in the last step requires a copy of your Snapchat data to download your memories to your computer. To get your account data from Snapchat, navigate to [accounts.snapchat.com](http://accounts.snapchat.com) and log in. Once logged in, you'll see a dashboard with various account management options.

Click on the "My Data" button to view the **My Data** page, where you can request a copy of your data.

[![Snapchat Account Dashboard](/blog-images/memory-download/snapchat-account-dashboard.png)](http://accounts.snapchat.com/accounts/welcome)

Once on the **My Data** page, scroll down and click the "Submit Request" button.

[![Snapchat Submit Request](/blog-images/memory-download/snapchat-submit-request.png)](http://accounts.snapchat.com/accounts/downloadmydata)

You'll then be informed that your data is being prepared, and an email will be sent to you shortly. Once you receive an email from Snapchat, click on the link provided to download a copy of your data. You'll want to unzip the data so that you can access the contents within it.

Now, your computer has everything it needs to download your memories.

## Select your memory data and a download location

Return to the **memory-download** application on your computer. When you first open the app, you are shown an overview, which describes the process of downloading your memories.

You've already completed the first two steps, so you can skip these steps.

While on the step 3 screen, click "Choose file" to select the `memories_history.json` file that is located within your data downloaded from Snapchat. You must also select a folder to which all of your memories should be downloaded. *Selecting an empty folder is recommended.*

Once you've selected the input file and a download folder, you can start the download by clicking the "Begin download" button.

## Await the memory download

This is by far the hardest step. *Waiting*...

![Await download](/blog-images/memory-download/app-screen-4.png)

The app will download all of your memories from Snapchat. This part can take a long time, depending on the number of memories saved to your account.

Ensure that your computer does not fall asleep or lock its screen while the download is in progress. If this happens, the download will be interrupted and will need to be entirely restarted.

## Enjoy your memories

![Download complete](/blog-images/memory-download/app-screen-5.png)

Once the application has completed downloading your memories, it will show you the "Your download is complete" message.

Click the "View memories" button to open the folder containing all your memories with your file browser.

You can now view all of your Snapchat memories on your computer.
