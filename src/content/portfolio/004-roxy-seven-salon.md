Roxy Seven Salon is a local hair salon that I grew up close to in my hometown Waukee, Iowa. I reached out to Laura – the owner – and asked if she wanted a website for her business. I made her website for free since it was my first website I had ever made other than small projects in Web Design courses at my high school.

I worked closely with Laura and asked for her input on the overall layout & appearance of the site, and made sure that she was happy with the final product.
