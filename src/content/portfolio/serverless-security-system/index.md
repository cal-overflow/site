If I only had two sentences to describe this project, I would say:
> A full-stack cloud-based security system involving data several simultaneous data streams from hardware devices. \
> Oh, and it's serverless!

Although I didn't realize it while starting the project, I was beginning development on my most complex project yet.

In this section I'll dissect the many components that work together in this Serverless Security System.

You read that right! I have dedicated an entire section to this project, instead of a single post. I actually had to add support for nested sections in [my website](/portfolio/build-a-blog) just so that I could document this project appropriately.

### This is a work in progress
This section is **not yet complete**. I will be publishing one post at a time, ideally at a rate of two posts per month. My goal is to complete the system (and these posts) by the middle of the year.

Note that some links will not function while this section is incomplete.
