Although I didn't realize it while starting the project, I was beginning development on my most complex project yet.

You read that right! I have dedicated an entire section to this project, instead of a single post. I actually had to add support for nested sections in [my website](/portfolio/build-a-blog) just so that I could document this project appropriately.
