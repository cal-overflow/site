### Hi. I'm cal. <hand-wave />

*Welcome to my corner of the internet.* \
I'm a software engineer. I love pretty much anything that has to do with computers. I also fancy long walks outside üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I'm not one for writing an extensive bio; besides, I think a lot of my work speaks for itself. Have a look around my portfolio to get a good sense of my work.

**I'm currently** becoming a [cloud](/cloud) guru.

If you want to get in touch or have any questions while viewing my website, please feel free to [reach out to me](/contact).
