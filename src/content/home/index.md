### Hi. I'm cal. <hand-wave />

I'm a *junior* software engineer who happens to be a *senior* computer science student. I love pretty much anything that has to do with computers.

I'm not one for writing an extensive bio; besides, I think a lot of my work speaks for itself. Have a look around my portfolio to get a good sense of my work.

**I'm currently working on** mostly [cloud](/cloud) stuff ☁️

If you want to get in touch or have any questions while viewing my website, please feel free to [reach out to me](/contact).
