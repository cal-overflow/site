### Hi. I'm cal. <hand-wave />

*Welcome to my corner of the internet.* \
I'm a software engineer. I love pretty much everything that has to do with computers. I also fancy long walks outside üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
<!--I am a strong believer in the [Personal Web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zswyWBtF-7Y)... MySpace might have been  onto something good before Facebook came along and made the internet into what it is today ü§î-->

I'm not one for writing an extensive bio; besides, I think a lot of my work speaks for itself. Have a look around my [portfolio](/portfolio) to get a good sense of what I like to build.

If you want to get in touch or have any questions while viewing my website, please feel free to [reach out to me](/contact).
