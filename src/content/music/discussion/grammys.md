**The Grammy awards are subtly racist and politically motivated**.

In this post, I'll go over the most obvious (and incredibly frustrating) examples of this.

**TL;DR:** Don't watch the grammy's. Don't base your music taste off of the Grammy's.

### 2018: Best Rap Album
Okay. You have four choices:
- [EXCELLENT] [ASTROWORLD](/music/albums/astroworld) (Travis Scott)
- [EXCELLENT] Swimming (Mac Miller)
- [GREAT] Victory Lap (Nipsey Hussle)
- [GREAT] Daytona (Pusha T)
- [GOOD] Scorpion (Drake)
- [MEDIOCRE] Invasion of Privacy[^1]

Guess which choice won? That's right, **Invasion of Privacy**. Maybe you can call the album "great," but that would mean the other albums are "astronomically great." \
This choice may not have a clear political motivation. Instead I think this is just an indication that the Grammys are so out of touch with the music industry and what music people enjoy.

### 2019: "Urban"
Tyler, The Creator created the amazing *pop* album [Igor](/music/albums/igor). Simple as that, right? Not for the Grammys. They manage to move the album into the *rap* category. Although Tyler won the award, he expressed his feelings in the speech below.

### 2020: After Hours
[After hours](/music/albums/after-hours), the critically acclaimed album, ruled the charts for years after its initial release in 2020. However, did the Grammy's include a single nomination for the album or its hit singles in the 63rd Grammys? **Of course not**. That would require the Grammys to understand what music people are listening to.

If you can't see the problem with this one then I don't know what to tell you. \
**The biggest song of all time (Blinding Lights) doesn't even get nominated for a Grammy? The Grammy's are dumb.**

I stopped paying attention entirely to the Grammys after the 2020 nonsense. I've heard of similar controversies happening in recent years, but I don't need another reason to hate the Grammys since I don't watch them.

I encourage you to stop watching the Grammys (and other CBS award shows) if you currently watch them.


[^1]: I literally know only one person that enjoyed a single song (one that featured another artist they fancy) off this album. Whereas each of the other albums have (multiple) songs that almost everyone knows.
