Do you know that one hit song, *Miss You*? You know, the one that blew up in late 2022 and dominated the charts? \
You're probably thinking, **"Oh, that one Oliver Tree song!"**

**Yes, but no.** \
Here's the thing; someone else made that song.

Although the song lyrics are directly taken from Oliver Tree's *Jerk*, the melody and instrumental behind *Miss You* (the hit-defining features) is from a completely different artist.

**Note:** This isn't a post about Ghostwriting. That's an entirely different discussion in and of itself. This post is about the hit song *miss you* and how Oliver Tree is taking credit for someone else's work.

## Miss You
I don't want to bore you to death on the song's history. I'll just give you the basics.

### 2020
Oliver Tree releases his debut album, *Ugly is Beautiful*. The album's 11<sup>th</sup> track is called *Jerk*.

The song is pretty damn good, but nowhere near a smash hit.

### 2022
#### May
*southstar*, an underground DJ from Germany releases a track titled *Miss You*. The track samples the vocals from Oliver Tree's *Jerk*.

The rights to sample these vocals were not yet cleared. However, the original instrumental and different melody of Miss You made the track incredibly catchy.

#### July
*southstar* re-releases *Miss You* after recording custom vocals.

#### August
Oliver Tree pairs up with DJ Robin Schulz release a track called *Miss You*. **It's unarguably a recreation of *southstar*'s Miss You.** 

Give the track a listen if you don't believe me.

## The rest is history
From there, Oliver Tree and Robin Schulz gained a lot of attention and credit for their stolen track *Miss You*. \
*southstar* lost the credit that he very much deserved because Oliver Tree failed to properly acknowledge him.

Before all this I enjoyed Oliver Tree's music. I'm not sure that I care to support Oliver Tree after this. \
I hope this post has been insightful into how the massive hit *miss you* was created. I, for one, prefer the *southstar* version.

*southstar* definitely takes the crown between the two music videos, too.
