**Let's go back in time to March 2020** \
The Weeknd is dropping a new album. Here's what we know:
<!--more-->
- 14 tracks
- 2 singles
- No features
- Producers: (just to name a few)
  - Metro Boomin
  - DaHeala & Illangelo
  - OPN

This information alone tells us ***this album is gonna SLAP...***


I could talk about this album for days. Instead, I'll write my opinion/review in a concise[^1] post.

---

For starters, this is undoubtedly **my favorite album of all time.** Before the album release, I was a big fan of The Weeknd's past work. I enjoyed all his previous releases extensively.

After Hours is a prime example of why nearly every musician under the sun claims working with the Weeknd is such a legendary experience.

This album holds a concise 14 tracks[^2] and there are arguably no skips[^3].

## Track-by-track breakdown
I'm going to break down each track on this album. There is much to discuss!

If you have the time, I recommend grabbing some headphones and listening to the album while reading my thoughts below :) \
There's a link to the album on Spotify at the bottom of this page.

### TODO list

Once all of these are checked, make sure you go through and **review the entire thing**. Front to back!

  #### Alone Again
  > Take off my disguise \
  > I'm living someone else's life \
  > Suppressing who I was inside

  > Together we're alone

  > How much to light up my star again \
  > And rewire all my thoughts?

  > Oh, baby won't you remind me what I am \
  > And break, break my little cold heart?

  > Call me up and I'll send for you \
  > Take me down to your altitude

  #### Too Late
  > I can't trust where I live anymore  \
  > Sources say that we're done, how would they know?

  > We're in Hell, it's disguised as a paradise with flashing lights

  #### Hardest to Love
  > If I held you back, at least I held you close

  > And what we had is dead inside, yeah \
  > You're actin' like it's still alive

  > Together we are so alone

  #### Scared to Live
  > If I held you back at least I held you close

  > Refused to be the one to taint your heart

  #### Snowchild
  > I used to pray when I was sixteen \
  > If I didn't make it, then I'd probably‚ÄÖmake‚ÄÖmy wrist bleed

  > Every month another accusation \
  > Only thing I'm phobic of is failing

  #### Escape from LA
  > You just wanted by attention \
  > You just wanted my affection \
  > **You got me tattooed on your mind** \
  > You just want me all the time

  > We'll figure out our shit and find a way \
  > When you say that you need space, I give you space \
  > Girl, when you're ready, you know where I stay

  #### Heartless
  > I lost my heart and my mind \
  > I try to always do right \
  > I thought I lost you this time \
  > You just came back in my life \
  > You never gave up on me (Why don't you?) \
  > I'll never know what you see (Why won't you?)

  #### Faith
  > And if you know me \
  > When I go missing, you know where to find me

  > I lost my faith \
  > I'm losing my religion every day \
  > Time hasn't been kind to me, I pray \
  > When I look inside the mirror and see someone I love \
  > Oh, someone I love

  #### Blinding Lights
  > When I'm like this you're the one I trust

  > I'm just calling back to let you know \
  > I could never say it on the phone \
  > Will never let you go this time

  #### In Your Eyes
  > I'd rather‚ÄÖbe so oblivious \
  > I'd rather be with‚ÄÖyou

  > You lie, but I don't let it define you

  #### Save Your Tears
  > I saw you dancing in a crowded room \
  > You look so happy when I'm not with you \
  > But then you saw me, caught you by surprise \
  > A single teardrop falling from your eye \
  > I don't know why I run away \
  > I make you cry when I run away

  > You could've asked me why I broke your heart \
  > You could've told me that you fell apart \
  > But you walked past me like I wasn't there \
  > And just pretended like you didn't care

## Other thoughts
### WHY IS THIS SO GOOD?
This is the saddest album I've ever heard. Yet it's also the most upbeat pop album that I can't stop listening to. The reason for this is simple: The lyrics tell the saddest story, yet it's all behind a smooth and catchy upbeat pop anthem. Here's a quick rundown on the overall tone of each song's writing and instruments:

|  | Writing | Instrumentally |
| --: | :--: | :--: |
| Alone Again | Tragic | Sad |
| Too Late | Sad | Upbeat |
| Hardest to Love | Sad | Sad/Upbeat |
| Scared to Live | Sad | Sad|
| Snowchild | Somber | Upbeat |
| Escape From LA | Sad | Somber |
| Heartless | Sad | Upbeat |
| Faith | Tragic | Upbeat |
| Blinding Lights | Tragic | Upbeat |
| In Your Eyes | Tragic | Upbeat |
| Save Your Tears | Tragic | Upbeat |
| Repeat After Me | Sad | Somber |
| After Hours | Tragic | Sad/Upbeat |
| Until I Bleed Out | Tragic | Sad |

As stated in [Too Late](/music/albums/after-hours/002-too-late), "We're in hell, it's disguised as paradise with flashing lights."


### NO GRAMMY?
Are you fucking serious? \
This album actually **dominated** the music industry in 2020, but it was ignored by the Grammys. I already had my issues with the Grammys because of obvious Politically influenced nominations and choices, but this just solidified that the Grammys are completely out of touch with music.

See more about the terrible [Grammys](/music/discussion/grammys).

[^1]: Looking at it now, this post is far from concise. The post got so big that I broke it into multiple sections! ü§£

[^2]: I'm a sucker for a short tracklist (anything over 15 is usually prone to be flawed), so 14 tracks is üëå

[^3]: I typically skip Repeat after me, but I know A LOT of people absolutely adore the track, so I'll consider the album to have no skips.
