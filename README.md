## Getting Started
**Make your own website üë®‚Äçüíª** \
This website is modular so that the content and site structure is separate from the messy Vue components and JavaScript.

If you'd like a website similar to the author's ([cal-overflow.dev](http://www.cal-overflow.dev)), you can create one without needing to build it from scratch. 

**[Click here to get started](./getting-started.md)**

## Structure Overview
A high-level overview of how the website is structured. The different pieces involved are:
- [Sections](#sections)
- [Views](#views)
- [Posts](#posts)
- [Tags](#tags)

---

### Sections
Sections are defined as folders within the `src/content` folder. For instance, creating a `src/content/blog` folder will define a blog section within your website. **Each section must include an `index.md` defining metadata for the section.**

#### Metadata
##### Required
1. A title for the section
1. A `primaryView` in which to render for the section's default route (i.e., `/blog/` for `src/content/blog/index.md`)
1. A `secondaryView` in which to render for the section's sub routes (i.e., `/blog/post-1` for `src/content/blog/post-1.md`)

See more information on [views](#views) below.


##### Optional
1. A list of tags for the section


An example `index.md` metadata is shown below.
```yml
---
# Required
title: Blog
primaryView: post-feed # What view to show on /blog page
secondaryView: post-view # What is shown on pages like /blog/post-1, /blog/post-2, etc.

# Optional
tags:
  - Software Engineering
  - University Course
  - Backend
  - Frontend
---

This is the blog section.
```

---

### Views
Views are layouts assigned to a [section](#sections). \
Many sections include two views: A **primary view**, and a **secondary view**. Note that not all sections require a secondary-view (i.e., the home page of [cal-overflow.dev](https://cal-overflow.dev) - defined [here](https://github.com/cal-overflow/site/blob/a790b98d32ce3fa3087e75f878ee6b9002d6e300/src/content/home/index.md?plain=1#L3-L4))

An example use of views is the author's **portfolio section**. \
The primary view of this section is shown when viewing [cal-overflow.dev/portfolio](https://cal-overflow.dev/portfolio). \
The secondary view of the section is shown when viewing a specific item within the section. (i.e., [cal-overflow.dev/portfolio/we-all-start-somewhere](https://cal-overflow.dev/portfolio/we-all-start-somewhere)).

In this example, the views are:
- **Primary view**: `post-feed`
- **Secondary view**: `post-view` 


View example sections and their definitions [here](https://github.com/cal-overflow/site/tree/main/src/content).

### Posts üìù
Posts are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and converted to HTML with the [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) module. \
Each post is a markdown file within a section (i.e., `src/content/blog/` directory). An [example post](http://www.cal-overflow.dev/blog/com-s-309) is shown below.

  File: [`src/content/blog/004-com-s-309.md`](https://github.com/cal-overflow/site/blob/main/src/content/blog/004-com-s-309.md?plain=1)

Computer Science 309 (Software Development Practices) is a course at Iowa State University that provides most students with their first software development-project experience.
Students are taught the basics of GitLab (version control platform), MySQL databases, Android Studio, and Spring Boot.

With this rudimentary knowledge, students are then allotted most of the semester to work on their group project.

View the Nuxt docs on [Writing Content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/writing) for more information on how to write posts.

#### Images
Feature images are placed within the same folder as the blog post (i.e., `src/content/blog/feature-images/com-s-309.png`). Other post images should be placed in `src/static/blog-images/`. See the [source code](https://github.com/cal-overflow/site) for [cal-overflow.dev](https://cal-overflow.dev) as an example.

---

### Tags
Post tags allow you to group posts within the same section together based on similarities such as topic. Post tags are defined in the sections `index.md` file.

Refer to the [sections](#sections) documentation above for more information on defining tags within a section. See the documentation for [posts](#posts-) to learn how to reference tags within a post.


---

## Additional Features
#### Placeholder images
By default, when a post is created without a corresponding feature image, [this placeholder](https://github.com/cal-overflow/site/blob/main/src/static/misc/placeholder.png) is used.

Customize the placeholder image by adding a `src/content/placeholder.png` image.
